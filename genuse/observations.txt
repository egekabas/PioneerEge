All shapes of size 1 and 2 are winners even if they are on their own.


All 3 sized shapes lose on their own but win if combined with another size 3 shape.
Informal Proof:
It is obvious that they lose on their own.

For the case of 
*** and *
        *
        *
This is just a basic winning shape in the original Harary xor game.

So, if we prove that shapes that are variations of
** are winners when combined with any other 3 sized shape our proof is complete 
*.

For two shapes that are 
**
*. variations =>

                                00
Each of these shapes consist of ** with an additional block in one of the places labeled 0.
                                00
It is trivial to reach a position where

00000    00000
02110 or 01120
00000    00000

(1s are grids occupied by player 1, 2s are grids occupied by player 2 and 0s are empty grids)
and its the second players turn. If it was player 1s turn, he would have 2 places that he could 
occupy and immediately win. Player 2 cannot occupy both of these places, so player 1 is winning.

    **
For *. variations, we can also see they consist of 0*0 with an additional block in one of the places labeled 0.
                                                   0*0

For *** coupled with a ** variation we can again reach this position.
                       *.
00000    00000
02110 or 01120
00000    00000

For * coupled with a ** variation we can reach another similar position.
    *                *.
    *

000    000
020    010
010 or 010
010    020
000    000

Both of there situations are winning for player 1 for the same reasons as discussed above.



Idea for bigger shapes:
In the original paper, it is stated that player 2 can win using the "domino method".
This method can be also useful in this variation as well.
With a program, all possible domino tilings could be enumarated. Then, it could be determined
which shapes cannot be put over which tilings without covering up at least one full domino piece.
Then, if all the shapes in a certain set have one domino tiling in common player 2 has a winning
strategy.
